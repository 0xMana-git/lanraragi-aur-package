## note: if the installation of CryptDES breaks, you need to install it globally with perl:

1. down and unpack this: `http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/D/DP/DPARIS/Crypt-DES-2.07.tar.gz`
2. replace the file _des.h with the one in the repo
3. run `perl Makefile.PL` then `sudo make install`(yeah i think u need root)
4. proceed as normal, should work
